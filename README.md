# Strawberry Field
A module that adds a field type that stores JSON data and makes its internal data available to other Drupal modules + a lot of smashing and mangling, event driven things and cool, weird metadata stuff. Core module of the Archipelago Commons Project.

**Note:** This module uses MySQL's JSON features and it is incompatible with all versions prior to 5.7.
